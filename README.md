#This is my Impressionist Painter App. This app was created and ran using Android Studio. My phone and the emulator served as my devices to test the app.  The features that this app has include:
# Circle, Square, Line Brush Types
# Brush Type that is set dynamically by the speed of the finger
# Load images from your gallery
# Ability to save your painting
# Ability to clear your painting
# Brush type that is complimentary of the normal brush color
  
# This project was built with the help of the Skeleton Code on the CMSC434 Class Webpage
